My favorite climate change fact that will blow liberal’s minds.,"My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect. As usual with over politicized subjects, the truth requires nuance and pleases neither extreme.",https://i.redd.it/323dbhex9vq91.jpg,Conservative,9/29/2022 21:35

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

When will climate change end the world?,"Hi, I’m a young person that’s concerned about my future due to climate change. I’m not scared to die, I’ve come to accept that my life won’t last forever and that we have to embrace death with open arms. I do however, want to live till I’m old. I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Climate change? It's handled.,"I am a HVAC technician. I am literally in hundreds of people's homes a year. I've met all kinds of people. Different religions. Different nationalities. Different cultures. You  get the picture. I am in the southwestern part of the US. It is hot! The heat is unbearable. I am on a service call. This lady answers the door. She must be mid to late 60s. Seems nice. I find out her problem. She needs a new thermostat. So while I am changing it out she is flipping through the tv channels. She stops on a news channel and they are talking about climate change. I casually mention how bad it is and we need to take some precautions. She says ""Climate  change? Oh, its handled.

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

My favorite climate change fact that will blow liberal’s minds.,"My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities.

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I'm really curious why people aren't fucking pissed at those in power.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable.

"I know this sub mostly posts about climate change, but climate change aside, we are still so screwed and it's terrifying.","Just looking at the very near-term, we are just so fucked and it crosses my mind multiple times a day. Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""? I could keep going on, but I'm sure you all get it. We are fucked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/166ti0n/i_know_this_sub_mostly_posts_about_climate_change/,collapse,9/1/2023 1:28

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I'm really curious why people aren't fucking pissed at those in power.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

When will climate change end the world?,"Hi, I’m a young person that’s concerned about my future due to climate change. I’m not scared to die, I’ve come to accept that my life won’t last forever and that we have to embrace death with open arms. I do however, want to live till I’m old. I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Different cultures. You  get the picture. I am in the southwestern part of the US. It is hot! The heat is unbearable. I am on a service call. This lady answers the door. She must be mid to late 60s. Seems nice. I find out her problem. She needs a new thermostat. So while I am changing it out she is flipping through the tv channels. She stops on a news channel and they are talking about climate change. I casually mention how bad it is and we need to take some precautions. She says ""Climate  change? Oh, its handled.

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

My favorite climate change fact that will blow liberal’s minds.,"My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

When will climate change end the world?,"Hi, I’m a young person that’s concerned about my future due to climate change.

I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities.

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I'm really curious why people aren't fucking pissed at those in power.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable.

"I know this sub mostly posts about climate change, but climate change aside, we are still so screwed and it's terrifying.","Just looking at the very near-term, we are just so fucked and it crosses my mind multiple times a day. Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""? I could keep going on, but I'm sure you all get it. We are fucked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/166ti0n/i_know_this_sub_mostly_posts_about_climate_change/,collapse,9/1/2023 1:28

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""? I could keep going on, but I'm sure you all get it. We are fucked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/166ti0n/i_know_this_sub_mostly_posts_about_climate_change/,collapse,9/1/2023 1:28

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Young people feel like they have no future due to climate change; we need to change the narrative,,https://hannahritchie.substack.com/p/young-climate-anxiety,Futurology,12/18/2022 20:39
When will climate change end the world?,"Hi, I’m a young person that’s concerned about my future due to climate change. I’m not scared to die, I’ve come to accept that my life won’t last forever and that we have to embrace death with open arms. I do however, want to live till I’m old. I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ynwqms/when_will_climate_change_end_the_world/,climatechange,11/6/2022 17:35
CMV: Climate Change is a lie,"I have grown up in the Bible belt all of my life. I attended a private Christian school from K-12. Every time I hear about climate change I have been told that it isn't really happening. I don't know the truth at this point, but some direction would be nice. It seems difficult to believe that humanity has need doing some serious shit to the planet that could disrupt its order. The arguments I hear the most are: 'Volcanic activity and other natural events dwarf the human output of pollutants' and 'the trees can balance out the CO2 levels in the atmosphere.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/25wv2e/cmv_climate_change_is_a_lie/,changemyview,5/19/2014 3:11

Climate change? It's handled.,"I am a HVAC technician. I am literally in hundreds of people's homes a year. I've met all kinds of people. Different religions. Different nationalities. Different cultures. You  get the picture. I am in the southwestern part of the US. It is hot! The heat is unbearable. I am on a service call. This lady answers the door. She must be mid to late 60s. Seems nice. I find out her problem. She needs a new thermostat. So while I am changing it out she is flipping through the tv channels. She stops on a news channel and they are talking about climate change. I casually mention how bad it is and we need to take some precautions. She says ""Climate  change? Oh, its handled. God is going to fix it. You'll see."" Ok. Handed her the bill and made my exit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/15srs93/climate_change_its_handled/,atheism,8/16/2023 14:42

The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

My favorite climate change fact that will blow liberal’s minds.,"My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

When will climate change end the world?,"Hi, I’m a young person that’s concerned about my future due to climate change. I’m not scared to die, I’ve come to accept that my life won’t last forever and that we have to embrace death with open arms. I do however, want to live till I’m old. I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities.

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I'm really curious why people aren't fucking pissed at those in power.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

My favorite climate change fact that will blow liberal’s minds.,"My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable.

Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""? I could keep going on, but I'm sure you all get it. We are fucked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/166ti0n/i_know_this_sub_mostly_posts_about_climate_change/,collapse,9/1/2023 1:28

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

"I know this sub mostly posts about climate change, but climate change aside, we are still so screwed and it's terrifying.","Just looking at the very near-term, we are just so fucked and it crosses my mind multiple times a day. Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""? I could keep going on, but I'm sure you all get it. We are fucked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/166ti0n/i_know_this_sub_mostly_posts_about_climate_change/,collapse,9/1/2023 1:28

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

CMV: Climate Change is a lie,"I have grown up in the Bible belt all of my life. I attended a private Christian school from K-12. Every time I hear about climate change I have been told that it isn't really happening. I don't know the truth at this point, but some direction would be nice. It seems difficult to believe that humanity has need doing some serious shit to the planet that could disrupt its order. The arguments I hear the most are: 'Volcanic activity and other natural events dwarf the human output of pollutants' and 'the trees can balance out the CO2 levels in the atmosphere.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/25wv2e/cmv_climate_change_is_a_lie/,changemyview,5/19/2014 3:11

Climate change? It's handled.,"I am a HVAC technician. I am literally in hundreds of people's homes a year. I've met all kinds of people. Different religions. Different nationalities. Different cultures. You  get the picture. I am in the southwestern part of the US. It is hot! The heat is unbearable. I am on a service call. This lady answers the door. She must be mid to late 60s. Seems nice. I find out her problem. She needs a new thermostat. So while I am changing it out she is flipping through the tv channels. She stops on a news channel and they are talking about climate change. I casually mention how bad it is and we need to take some precautions. She says ""Climate  change? Oh, its handled. God is going to fix it. You'll see."" Ok. Handed her the bill and made my exit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/15srs93/climate_change_its_handled/,atheism,8/16/2023 14:42

Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

My favorite climate change fact that will blow liberal’s minds.,"My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

When will climate change end the world?,"Hi, I’m a young person that’s concerned about my future due to climate change. I’m not scared to die, I’ve come to accept that my life won’t last forever and that we have to embrace death with open arms. I do however, want to live till I’m old. I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities.

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I'm really curious why people aren't fucking pissed at those in power.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities.

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I'm really curious why people aren't fucking pissed at those in power.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

"I know this sub mostly posts about climate change, but climate change aside, we are still so screwed and it's terrifying.","Just looking at the very near-term, we are just so fucked and it crosses my mind multiple times a day. Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""? I could keep going on, but I'm sure you all get it. We are fucked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/166ti0n/i_know_this_sub_mostly_posts_about_climate_change/,collapse,9/1/2023 1:28

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

Seems nice. I find out her problem. She needs a new thermostat. So while I am changing it out she is flipping through the tv channels. She stops on a news channel and they are talking about climate change. I casually mention how bad it is and we need to take some precautions. She says ""Climate  change? Oh, its handled. God is going to fix it. You'll see."" Ok. Handed her the bill and made my exit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/15srs93/climate_change_its_handled/,atheism,8/16/2023 14:42

Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

My favorite climate change fact that will blow liberal’s minds.,"My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect. As usual with over politicized subjects, the truth requires nuance and pleases neither extreme.",https://i.redd.it/323dbhex9vq91.jpg,Conservative,9/29/2022 21:35

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

When will climate change end the world?,"Hi, I’m a young person that’s concerned about my future due to climate change. I’m not scared to die, I’ve come to accept that my life won’t last forever and that we have to embrace death with open arms. I do however, want to live till I’m old. I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

My favorite climate change fact that will blow liberal’s minds.,"My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities.

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I'm really curious why people aren't fucking pissed at those in power.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable.

"I know this sub mostly posts about climate change, but climate change aside, we are still so screwed and it's terrifying.","Just looking at the very near-term, we are just so fucked and it crosses my mind multiple times a day. Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""? I could keep going on, but I'm sure you all get it. We are fucked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/166ti0n/i_know_this_sub_mostly_posts_about_climate_change/,collapse,9/1/2023 1:28

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I'm really curious why people aren't fucking pissed at those in power.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

When will climate change end the world?,"Hi, I’m a young person that’s concerned about my future due to climate change. I’m not scared to die, I’ve come to accept that my life won’t last forever and that we have to embrace death with open arms. I do however, want to live till I’m old. I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Different cultures. You  get the picture. I am in the southwestern part of the US. It is hot! The heat is unbearable. I am on a service call. This lady answers the door. She must be mid to late 60s. Seems nice. I find out her problem. She needs a new thermostat. So while I am changing it out she is flipping through the tv channels. She stops on a news channel and they are talking about climate change. I casually mention how bad it is and we need to take some precautions. She says ""Climate  change? Oh, its handled.

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

My favorite climate change fact that will blow liberal’s minds.,"My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

When will climate change end the world?,"Hi, I’m a young person that’s concerned about my future due to climate change.

I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities.

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I'm really curious why people aren't fucking pissed at those in power.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable.

"I know this sub mostly posts about climate change, but climate change aside, we are still so screwed and it's terrifying.","Just looking at the very near-term, we are just so fucked and it crosses my mind multiple times a day. Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""? I could keep going on, but I'm sure you all get it. We are fucked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/166ti0n/i_know_this_sub_mostly_posts_about_climate_change/,collapse,9/1/2023 1:28

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""? I could keep going on, but I'm sure you all get it. We are fucked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/166ti0n/i_know_this_sub_mostly_posts_about_climate_change/,collapse,9/1/2023 1:28

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Young people feel like they have no future due to climate change; we need to change the narrative,,https://hannahritchie.substack.com/p/young-climate-anxiety,Futurology,12/18/2022 20:39
When will climate change end the world?,"Hi, I’m a young person that’s concerned about my future due to climate change. I’m not scared to die, I’ve come to accept that my life won’t last forever and that we have to embrace death with open arms. I do however, want to live till I’m old. I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/ynwqms/when_will_climate_change_end_the_world/,climatechange,11/6/2022 17:35
CMV: Climate Change is a lie,"I have grown up in the Bible belt all of my life. I attended a private Christian school from K-12. Every time I hear about climate change I have been told that it isn't really happening. I don't know the truth at this point, but some direction would be nice. It seems difficult to believe that humanity has need doing some serious shit to the planet that could disrupt its order. The arguments I hear the most are: 'Volcanic activity and other natural events dwarf the human output of pollutants' and 'the trees can balance out the CO2 levels in the atmosphere.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/25wv2e/cmv_climate_change_is_a_lie/,changemyview,5/19/2014 3:11

Climate change? It's handled.,"I am a HVAC technician. I am literally in hundreds of people's homes a year. I've met all kinds of people. Different religions. Different nationalities. Different cultures. You  get the picture. I am in the southwestern part of the US. It is hot! The heat is unbearable. I am on a service call. This lady answers the door. She must be mid to late 60s. Seems nice. I find out her problem. She needs a new thermostat. So while I am changing it out she is flipping through the tv channels. She stops on a news channel and they are talking about climate change. I casually mention how bad it is and we need to take some precautions. She says ""Climate  change? Oh, its handled. God is going to fix it. You'll see."" Ok. Handed her the bill and made my exit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/15srs93/climate_change_its_handled/,atheism,8/16/2023 14:42

The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

My favorite climate change fact that will blow liberal’s minds.,"My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

When will climate change end the world?,"Hi, I’m a young person that’s concerned about my future due to climate change. I’m not scared to die, I’ve come to accept that my life won’t last forever and that we have to embrace death with open arms. I do however, want to live till I’m old. I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities.

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I'm really curious why people aren't fucking pissed at those in power.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

My favorite climate change fact that will blow liberal’s minds.,"My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable.

Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""? I could keep going on, but I'm sure you all get it. We are fucked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/166ti0n/i_know_this_sub_mostly_posts_about_climate_change/,collapse,9/1/2023 1:28

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

"I know this sub mostly posts about climate change, but climate change aside, we are still so screwed and it's terrifying.","Just looking at the very near-term, we are just so fucked and it crosses my mind multiple times a day. Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""? I could keep going on, but I'm sure you all get it. We are fucked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/166ti0n/i_know_this_sub_mostly_posts_about_climate_change/,collapse,9/1/2023 1:28

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

CMV: Climate Change is a lie,"I have grown up in the Bible belt all of my life. I attended a private Christian school from K-12. Every time I hear about climate change I have been told that it isn't really happening. I don't know the truth at this point, but some direction would be nice. It seems difficult to believe that humanity has need doing some serious shit to the planet that could disrupt its order. The arguments I hear the most are: 'Volcanic activity and other natural events dwarf the human output of pollutants' and 'the trees can balance out the CO2 levels in the atmosphere.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/25wv2e/cmv_climate_change_is_a_lie/,changemyview,5/19/2014 3:11

Climate change? It's handled.,"I am a HVAC technician. I am literally in hundreds of people's homes a year. I've met all kinds of people. Different religions. Different nationalities. Different cultures. You  get the picture. I am in the southwestern part of the US. It is hot! The heat is unbearable. I am on a service call. This lady answers the door. She must be mid to late 60s. Seems nice. I find out her problem. She needs a new thermostat. So while I am changing it out she is flipping through the tv channels. She stops on a news channel and they are talking about climate change. I casually mention how bad it is and we need to take some precautions. She says ""Climate  change? Oh, its handled. God is going to fix it. You'll see."" Ok. Handed her the bill and made my exit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/15srs93/climate_change_its_handled/,atheism,8/16/2023 14:42

Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

My favorite climate change fact that will blow liberal’s minds.,"My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

When will climate change end the world?,"Hi, I’m a young person that’s concerned about my future due to climate change. I’m not scared to die, I’ve come to accept that my life won’t last forever and that we have to embrace death with open arms. I do however, want to live till I’m old. I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities.

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I'm really curious why people aren't fucking pissed at those in power.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

I came here to ask when will climate change wipe out all life on earth? I keep getting 2 answers as to when climate change will end the world, the first is that it will happen in “2050”, the second is that it will happen in “2100”. I’ve also heard that it won’t wipe out all life on earth and that humanity will instead go back to the tribal society days when we had to hunt for our food due to everything getting destroyed and less places being habitable. Which one of these answers is correct? Are none of them correct? Are any of them correct? Which one is it?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities.

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous. I'm really curious why people aren't fucking pissed at those in power.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores.

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

"I know this sub mostly posts about climate change, but climate change aside, we are still so screwed and it's terrifying.","Just looking at the very near-term, we are just so fucked and it crosses my mind multiple times a day. Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""? I could keep going on, but I'm sure you all get it. We are fucked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/166ti0n/i_know_this_sub_mostly_posts_about_climate_change/,collapse,9/1/2023 1:28

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/,environment,11/9/2016 4:45

CMV: The potential porblems of climate change are totally exaggerated.,"I agree that climate change is a problem. I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x7mati/cmv_the_potential_porblems_of_climate_change_are/,changemyview,9/6/2022 21:24

Seems nice. I find out her problem. She needs a new thermostat. So while I am changing it out she is flipping through the tv channels. She stops on a news channel and they are talking about climate change. I casually mention how bad it is and we need to take some precautions. She says ""Climate  change? Oh, its handled. God is going to fix it. You'll see."" Ok. Handed her the bill and made my exit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/15srs93/climate_change_its_handled/,atheism,8/16/2023 14:42

Housing prices and rent are through the roof, many groceries are up 130-140% just in the last year. Gas is high as shit, and our politics have become so absolutely fucked. It's terrifying. The most terrifying part is knowing that prices won't ever drop. Our best hope is that they only stop going up as fast. Our country is being run by a bunch of greedy senior citizens, and we have shady corporations having record high profits. How long until we are priced out of just having a ""regular boring life""?

Im really worried about Climate Change Migrations,"Take Canada - it is at its limit. GDP per head decreased from 55 000 in 2022 to 53 000 in 2023 and housing is unaffordable. Yet the government wants to bring in an additional 500 000+ people every year. An extra 500 000+ that will compete for scarce living space and resources. 

What is happening at the Southern US border is even worse with 2-4 Million entering the US every year. The same is happening in Europe with some 1-2 Million coming in every year.

And this is just the beginning. The population of Africa is predicted to double in the next 30-40 years, same goes for the Middle East. Yet these regions will be affected the hardest by climate change in the next decades.The situation in Central and South America will be a little better but still dire.

This means we are looking at something like 100+ Million people that will most likely want to flee to North America and possibly 200+ Million that will most likely want to flee to Europe.

This will be a migration of Biblical proportions and simply unsustainable. No Continent/country can allow such level of migration, especially with dwindling resources and food production capabilities. And I fear no matter what is being done about this problem it will lead to the collapse of entire countries and even continents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/18wlbsw/im_really_worried_about_climate_change_migrations/,collapse,1/2/2024 9:18

Are people just not interested in climate change?,"So the new IPCC report on climate change is out. As expected, bad news. The world has around 3 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change in a few decades. Sea levels rising (1-8 feet, displacing millions in just the US alone), droughts, more powerful storms, flooding, landslides. This would of course disproportionately affect the poorest people, as usual. A huge percentage of the world is already breathing polluted air on a daily basis. 

Are people not interested in this? I would think parents would care that the lives of their children are looking like they will be very different, likely hazardous.
